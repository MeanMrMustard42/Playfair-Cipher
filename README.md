# Playfair-Cipher
Playfair Cipher Decoder written as part of my participation in the Kryptos Contest 2023, hosted by Central Washington University. Parts of this project may still be in progress; please contact me at the email provided in my profile if you have any questions (or even just want to talk cryptology). 

This project is intended to be used by anyone who wants and/or needs it. If you're a cybersecurity student, a cryptologist, or even just a hobbyist, I hope the code I've written here can help inform your thinking and help you grow in your field. Best of luck!
